im thinking o a way to build on the support already present to enable people to use Spring integration and Activiti together. 

As it stands, there's a gateway component that lets me propagate execution to a component running inside of Spring Integration. One ideal of this projet is to describe a component model that gets invoked as a consequence of of any state to which its attached. Example:

@Component
public class Handler { 
  @ActivitiState ( "confirm-receipt") t
  public void myHandle ( @ProcessVariable("customerId") long customerId, @ProcessVariables Map<String,Object> variables, ExecutionContext ctx ) throws Throwable { 
    // custom logic here
  }
} 

or, to signa which transition the component needs to take:

@Component
public class Handler { 
  @ActivitiState ( "confirm-receipt") 
  public String myHandle ( @ProcessVariable("customerId") long customerId  ) throws Throwable { 
    // custom logic here
   return "failure"; 
  }
} 

 in that example the return value will be used to look up the next activiti state.
